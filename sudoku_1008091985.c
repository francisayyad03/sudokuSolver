/*
 * CSC A48 - Exercise 11 - Sudoku Solver
 * 
 * Your goal in this exercise is to practice recursion and
 * to see how a properly written recursive solution can
 * take care of fairly complicated tasks with a few lines
 * of (well thought out) code.
 * 
 * We will be solving Sudoku puzzles. In case you have never
 * solved or seen a Sudoku, you can learn more about them
 * here:
 * 
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku
 * 
 * Your task if to write a function that takes an input
 * Sudoku in the form of a 9x9 array of integers. the
 * array will have a few entries filled with numbers in
 * [1, 9], and the remaining entries set to zero.
 * 
 * For the example in the wiki, the input array will
 * be
 * 
 * 5 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 0
 * 6 0 0 1 9 5 0 0 0
 * 0 9 8 0 0 0 0 6 0
 * 8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3
 * 4 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 1
 * 7 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 6
 * 0 6 0 0 0 0 2 8 0 
 * 0 0 0 4 1 9 0 0 5
 * 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 7 9
 * 
 * Your code should find the values that correctly
 * complete the Sudoku. 
 * 
 * As a brief reminder, a correctly solved Sudoku is
 * one in which there are no repeated digits in any
 * row, any column, or any of the 3x3 sub-arrays that
 * make up the large 9x9 grid. Another way to think
 * about it is, every row, column, and 3x3 subgrid
 * uses all of the different digits.
 * 
 * How to solve this?
 * 
 * * RECURSIVELY!
 * 
 * (hint) - Solving a Sudoku with N unknown values
 * may involve trying something, then solving an
 * easier Sudoku problem.
 * 
 * * How to approach this?
 * 
 * - As noted in class:
 * 	a) Determine the base case(s)
 * 	b) Figure out the recursive case
 * 	c) Determine what needs to happen to
 * 	   the solution for the entire problem
 * 	   is returned once the recursion hits
 * 	   the base case(s)
 * 
 * - Conditions on the input Sudoku
 * 	- It will have AT LEAST ONE DIGIT in each
 * 	  3x3 subgrid. Likely there will be several
 * 	  3x3 subgrids with several digits already
 * 	  set to some value.
 * 
 * - Conditions on your solution
 * 	- It should return a solution if there
 * 	  exists one.
 * 	- If no solution can be found, return the
 * 	  original input array
 * 	- If multiple solutions exist, any one of
 *        them is valid
 * 
 * - Can I use helper functions?
 * 	- Yes, by all means!
 * 
 * - Can I add extra libraries?
 * 	- No, they won't be needed.
 * 
 * - Can I change the 'print_sudoku()' function?
 * 	- Please don't, we may need it for testing!
